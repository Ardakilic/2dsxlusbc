# PCB

Your PCBs might arrive with some [slight perforations, from the breakaway panelization design](https://github.com/Refuhr/2dsxlusbc/blob/main/images/pcb.jpg) during PCB manufacturing. These can be left alone, or optionally a side cutter can be used and the rest filed/sanded away.
Take the prepped PCB and solder the USB Type C Port and optionally the two resistors onto it.

# Install

### Step 1: Disassembly

Fully disassemble the 2ds XL and take out the motherboard. You can use the [ifixit guide](https://de.ifixit.com/Anleitung/New+Nintendo+2DS+XL+Motherboard+Replacement/128242?lang=en). Make sure to read the comments because some of the connectors shouldn't be bend upwards.

### Step 2: Removing the old port.

Put some new solder onto the pads with a soldering iron to make it easier to remove.

Now take a heat gun, heat up the pads and carefully use  tweezers to get the port out (optionally: I used some Kapton Tape to protect the other components).

### Step 4: Cleaning up the pads.

Now clean up the pads, so that there is a flat surface. You can use a desoldering pump or desoldering braid. I accidentally scratched the ground plane a bit, but that shouldn't cause any problems here.

### Step 5: soldering the new port in place.

Align the soldered PCB to the Pads on the side where the old connector was and keep it in place with tape or UHU Patafix/Blu-Tack (this works really well for keeping small PCBs in place for soldering).  
Now solder the PCB in place and you are almost done!

### Step 6: Modifying the shell and plastic parts.

Now modify the shell of the 2ds. I used some cheap files, which I bought for cleaning up 3d prints and filed a bit at the side. Be careful and go little by little when filing. You can always file something away but adding material is not so easy.

Modify this bracket, which holds the charging port in place. (insert picture).
