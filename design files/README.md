# History of the versions 
At first, I chose 0402 resistors for my hardware design to act as the pulldown resistors. They are incredibly small, which was helpful when trying to make the PCB as small as possible, and I was confident in hand soldering them. When @Ardakilic said that he wasn’t confident in hand soldering them, I designed two additional PCBs with the resistor size of 0603 and 0805. At the End the size difference between the smallest (0402) and the biggest (0805) is about 0.5 mm. So with almost no drawback in size it’s a lot easier to solder the resistors now (0602 and 0805 design not tested yet!).
